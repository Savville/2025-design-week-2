# Week 2: User Research & Personal Finance

## Challenge: Project Analysis

Your challenge is to analyze an open-source Bitcoin wallet and understand how it serves its users. You’ll research how the project presents itself, what users say about it, and how it aligns with known Bitcoin user personas.

### Step 1: Pick a Wallet

- Choose an open-source Bitcoin wallet to research.

### Step 2: Analyze Its Presentation

- Review its website, app store listing, and any public documentation.  
- Think about:  
  - How does the wallet present itself?  
  - Who seems to be its target audience?  
  - What messaging is used to speak to this audience?

### Step 3: Review Public Conversations

- Browse forums like GitHub, Telegram, Discord, and Twitter to see what people are saying about the project.  
- Look for:  
  - What are the features that people are asking for?  
  - What are the things that are working out well for users?  
  - What problems are users facing?

### Step 4: Persona Mapping

- Based on your findings, compare the wallet’s users to the Bitcoin personas from your reading.  
- Do any personas match the user base? If so, which ones?

### Submitting Your Work

**Deliverables:**

Your research report should include:

- Research methodology (How did you collect and analyze data?)  
- Data collection and analysis (Summarize key observations from your research)  
- Persona mapping (Which Bitcoin personas match this project?)  
- Key takeaways (What did you learn?)  
- Recommendations (Any improvements for the wallet’s user experience?)

### Evaluation Criteria

Your work will be evaluated based on:

- Did you choose appropriate research methods and approaches?  
- How deep is your analysis?  
- Did you identify actionable insights?  
- How good is the quality of your documentation?
